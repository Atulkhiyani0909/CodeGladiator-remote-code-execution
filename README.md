## 🚀 Introduction

**Code Gladiator** is a 1v1 coding battle platform. It connects developers via WebSockets for real-time algorithmic duels. Unlike standard coding platforms, Code Gladiator focuses on **concurrency, speed, and live competition**.

It features an anonymous matchmaking system, isolated code execution environments using Docker, and a global Elo-based ranking system.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This project utilizes an **Event-Driven Architecture** to handle high-concurrency code submissions without blocking the main server threads.



**The Data Flow:**
1.  **Matchmaking:** Users join a Queue via WebSocket. The server pairs them and spins up a unique `RoomID`.
2.  **Submission:** When a user submits code, it is pushed to a **Redis Queue**.
3.  **Processing:** A separate Worker Service pulls the code from Redis.
4.  **Execution:** The Worker spins up an isolated **Docker Container** to execute the code safely (preventing infinite loops/malicious attacks).
5.  **Result:** The output is published back to Redis (Pub/Sub), which notifies the WebSocket server to update the frontend client.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18+)
* Docker (Desktop ) running
* PostgreSQL Database
* Redis instance 

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Atulkhiyani0909/CodeGladiator.git]
cd code-gladiator
```

###2. Infrastructure Setup (Docker)
If you don't have Postgres/Redis installed locally, you can spin them up via Docker:
``` bash
# (Optional) Run Redis and Postgres via Docker Compose
docker run -d --name gladiator-redis -p 6379:6379 redis ]
```

### 3. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder (or root if monolithic):

```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Setup Database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
